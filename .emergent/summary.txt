The AI engineer successfully addressed a series of critical UI/UX bugs and enhanced existing features in a React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. The trajectory began with clarifying a 400 Bad Request error, which was determined to be an intended business rule. Subsequent work focused on fixing UI display issues: a timezone problem in timestamps, incorrect sponsoring calculation displays, tablet responsiveness issues (overlapping text on the homepage and dashboard), and inconsistent terminology (Süßes to Snacks). A critical double-calculation bug in the sponsoring logic was identified and resolved in the backend. A new feature, a sponsoring lock (to prevent orders after a sponsorship), was implemented. Finally, the display of orders in the admin dashboard was standardized (red, negative values), topping labels were capitalized, and balance updates for Andere WA were fixed. The work concluded with the user requesting to fork the codebase.

<product_requirements>
The Canteen Management System for German fire department employees manages meal orders with administrative controls, designed for a multi-department model. Employees have a primary Stamm-Wachabteilung (home department) and can order as temporary members in other departments, using sub-accounts.

Key product requirements and implemented features include:
1.  **Unified Employee ID**: Single database entry per person, usable across all four Wachabteilungen.
2.  **Four Separate Accounts per Employee**: Main account for home, three sub-accounts for others, tracking Breakfast/Lunch and Drinks/Sweets balances.
3.  **Temporary Employee Feature**: Admins can temporarily add employees; guest orders book to sub-accounts; orders are cancellable same day; auto-expire end-of-day. Server-side persistence was in progress/partially done.
4.  **Differentiated UI Display**: Employee profiles show main balances prominently, sub-account balances compactly, with history filtered by department.
5.  **Admin Dashboard Andere WA Tab**: Overview and management of temporary employees' sub-account bookings, including balance management.
6.  **Full Booking & Sponsoring Functionality**: Integrated with sub-account structure, ensuring correct balance impact.
7.  **Daily Lunch Names**: Admins can set a name for lunch meals, displayed alongside price.

Recent bug fixes and improvements addressed:
*   Corrected timezone display in history.
*   Fixed incorrect sponsoring calculation display.
*   Improved tablet responsiveness for homepage and admin dashboard.
*   Changed Süßes/Süßware to Snacks terminology across the UI.
*   Resolved a critical double-counting bug in sponsoring balance updates.
*   Implemented an automatic sponsoring lock to prevent further breakfast/lunch orders post-sponsoring, while allowing snacks/drinks.
*   Standardized order display in Admin Dashboard (red, negative values).
*   Corrected capitalization of topping details in order history.
*   Ensured automatic balance updates in Andere WA tab after transactions.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains all API logic, database interactions, and core business rules.
    -   **Changes Summary**:
        -   **Sponsoring Logic**: Corrected double-counting bug in  by removing redundant balance updates (around lines 4506, 4514, 4592, 4601).
        -   **Sponsoring Lock**: Added  collection and logic to  to create a daily lock. Modified  to enforce this lock (preventing breakfast/lunch orders but allowing drinks/snacks) and  to prevent reopening if a sponsorship occurred (lines 4635, 1905, 3470).
        -   **Breakfast Summary**: Corrected  calculation logic to ensure  and  are always updated, not just within the toppings loop (around lines 2500, 2548, 2567).
        -   ** removal**: Removed  generation in  (around lines 4505, 4593) as it was incorrectly calculated and redundant.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React application, managing UI, state, and API calls.
    -   **Changes Summary**:
        -   **Timestamp Formatting**: Modified  to specify  for accurate display (line 382).
        -   **Sponsoring Display**: Changed display to use  instead of  for correct sponsoring messages (line 824).
        -   **Tablet Responsiveness**: Adjusted  grid layout (around line 1070) and text sizes () for better display at 1024px. Employee list () and  (lines 1408, 6902) were optimized with  and adjusted grid/column widths.
        -   **Terminology Update**: Süßes/Süßware consistently replaced with Snacks in various UI elements, modals, and labels (, , ,  around lines 525, 6800, 3160, 1985).
        -   **Andere WA Balance Update**: Implemented refresh mechanisms ( callback,  on tab focus, interval refresh) to ensure balances in the Andere WA tab update automatically after payments (lines 6800, 389, 461).
        -   **Sponsoring Lock UI**: Adapted UI for the sponsoring lock to match the breakfast closing UI (orange banner, clock icon, generic message without sponsor name, around line 2060).
        -   **Admin Orders Display**: Modified the display of  in the Bestellungen verwalten modal to show negative, red values for orders (lines 3559-3560).
        -   **Topping Capitalization**: Enhanced  to use a mapping for capitalizing topping names like Spiegelei instead of spiegelei (lines 3444-3451, 1777-1781).
        -   **Breakfast Summary Table**: Unified column widths and adjusted header texts for a more compact and balanced look (lines 5354, 5450).
        -   **Mittagessen Column Repositioning**: Moved the Mittagessen column in the  to be between the employee name and toppings (around lines 5370, 5430, 5450).
        -   **Temporary Employee Alert**: Removed the confirmation alert when adding a temporary employee (around line 6800).

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of the server-side solution for temporary employee persistence to ensure cross-device functionality.
-   Test the newly implemented server-side temporary employee persistence (including daily expiry).
-   Extend the frontend display in all views to use the Mittagessen-Namen wherever Mittagessen appears (not fully completed).
-   Complete the remaining frontend integrations for the Mittagessen-Namen feature across all views.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had just completed a series of bug fixes and UI/UX improvements. The last completed task involved ensuring the Andere WA (Other Departments) tab's sub-account balances updated automatically after transactions. This was achieved by implementing multiple refresh strategies in , including callback-based updates after payment, automatic refresh on tab-focus, and an interval refresh. Logging was also added for diagnostic purposes. The user then reviewed the changes, particularly confirming that several employees with sub-account bookings were visible, and the balances were now updating. Following this, the user explicitly requested to Fork the current codebase to secure the stable state before further tests and changes. The AI engineer's immediate action was to invoke the  to understand how to perform a Fork on the Emergent platform.

<optional_next_step>
