The AI engineer's trajectory showcases an iterative, problem-solving approach to a complex canteen management system. Initial efforts focused on fixing critical backend logic for meal sponsoring, ensuring correct balance adjustments, and implementing department-specific pricing for items like eggs and coffee. This required extensive modifications to  for new models and API endpoints, and numerous frontend updates in  to correctly fetch and display these dynamic prices. The process involved deep debugging of React state management, API pathing (e.g., resolving double  prefixes), and UI rendering conditions. Concurrently, several UI/UX issues were addressed, including consistent saldo color coding, label changes, and replacing native browser alerts with custom success/error modals. A significant challenge arose with order cancellation logic, where cancelled orders were incorrectly affected by price changes and prevented new bookings. The latest work involved creating a landing page, which immediately presented a CSS loading issue due to incorrect MIME type serving, indicating a server configuration problem. The engineer consistently communicated with the user, seeking clarifications and confirming fixes through testing.

<product_requirements>
The application is a canteen management system for German fire department employees, designed to streamline meal, drink, and sweets ordering.
**Key functional requirements and implemented features:**
1.  **Master Password:** A universal password for developer/admin access to all dashboards.
2.  **Order Cancellation Documentation:** Soft cancellation of orders, marked as Storniert, visible in chronological history for audit.
3.  **Flexible Payment System:** Replaces mark as paid with free-text input. Implements separate  and  saldo accounts, allowing positive/negative balances. Gesamtschulden removed, chronological history for all transactions.
4.  **Payment Protection:** Timestamp-based deletion lock to prevent order deletion after payment, with admin override.
5.  **UI/UX Refinements:** Correct Brötchen dropdown, standardized date formats, updated breakfast legend, pagination in admin dashboard, unified price adjustment UI, chronological history with  signs, and consistent saldo color coding (green for positive, red for negative).
6.  **Sponsoring Logic Correction:** Correctly credits sponsored employees' balances (setting to 0€) and debits the sponsor's balance for the full amount, ensuring all meal types are handled consistently.
7.  **Department-specific Pricing:** Each Wachabteilung (department) can set its own prices for items like eggs and coffee, independent of other departments.
8.  **Automatic UI Updates:** Prices and balances in the Admin Dashboard and employee views should refresh automatically after changes like sponsoring or price adjustments.
9.  **Custom Modals for Feedback:** Replace standard browser  for price updates and payments with custom success/error notification modals.
10. **Landing Page:** A modern, responsive one-page promotional website with features, screenshots, and an email contact form.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core API logic, database interactions, and business rules.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   **Sponsoring Logic**: Corrected logic for meal sponsoring (employees credited, sponsor debited correctly).
        *   **Department-Specific Prices**: Implemented  model and new API endpoints (, ) to manage department-level prices.
        *   **Lunch Price Adjustment**: Fixed a critical bug where price changes for lunch incorrectly calculated balance adjustments; reversed the  sign for correct debit/credit.
        *   **Cancellation Logic**: Modified order creation and lunch price adjustment queries to explicitly exclude cancelled orders () to prevent data inconsistencies.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React application, handles UI, state, and API calls.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   **UI/UX**: Standardized negative saldo colors to red, positive to green. Changed Frühstück Saldo to Frühstück/Mittag Saldo. Removed Gesamt Schulden and Gesamt Bestellungen from admin employee views.

        *   **Custom Modals**: Integrated  modals to replace browser  for price updates (Ei/Kaffee, Brötchen, Toppings, Getränke, Süßigkeiten) and flexible payments across , , and . Adjusted auto-close to 1 second.
        *   **Cancellation Logic**: Filtered out cancelled orders from  and  functions to ensure forms are not pre-filled with cancelled data and new orders can be placed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New directory for the promotional one-page landing site.
    -   **Files**: , , , . These were created but CSS loading issue is currently pending.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating a newly created one-page landing page (consisting of , , ,  in ) into the main GitHub repository. The user then reported that the CSS for this landing page was not loading.

Upon investigation (Chat 706-712), the console logs showed a critical error:

This error indicates that the web server (likely Apache, given previous configurations) is serving the  file with an incorrect MIME type (as  instead of ). This usually happens when the server cannot find the specified CSS file at the requested URL or is misconfigured to handle  files. The AI engineer has identified this as the current blocking issue.
