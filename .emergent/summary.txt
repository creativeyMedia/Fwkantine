The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates an iterative and robust development process for a canteen management system, effectively transitioning from foundational features to intricate bug fixes and enhancements. Initially, efforts focused on establishing core functionality, followed by a significant architectural shift to support department-specific products and pricing. The engineer consistently tackled complex UI/UX issues, such as the  runtime errors, unstable input fields, and the pervasive  display bug. A systematic approach to debugging was evident, often starting with backend data verification before moving to frontend adjustments. The latest work involved resolving persistent build errors stemming from React version incompatibilities and ESLint configuration, culminating in a stable, fully localized application ready for deployment, after meticulously addressing numerous user-reported issues including flexible ordering, drag-and-drop sorting, and refined currency formatting.

The objective is an in-house canteen management system for four German Wachabteilung (departments), featuring Euro-based pricing. Each department requires password-protected access and an admin for managing prices, menus, and employees. Key functionalities include: department cards, employee order history, dynamic lunch pricing, detailed breakfast ordering with roll halves and explicit topping assignments, and a matrix-style breakfast summary for kitchen staff. Recent implementations added boiled breakfast eggs with quantity selection and admin pricing. Critical fixes resolved pricing errors, authentication, order persistence, UI rendering issues (), and input stability. The system now supports department-specific products and prices. Recent user requests involved: independent admin/employee password changes, correcting Euro sign placement (13,00 €), simplifying topping creation, improving lunch display in summaries, enabling flexible breakfast orders (eggs/lunch without rolls), and implementing drag-and-drop for employee sorting. Deployment assistance and resolving compilation errors were also high priorities.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a series of critical deployment and development-related issues. The user reported persistent  and ESLint configuration errors () after a previous attempt to implement a logo in the application header. The AI engineer, with assistance from a , identified the root cause as a compatibility issue between React 19 and . The solution involved downgrading React to version 18.2.0 and iteratively fixing ESLint configurations within  to achieve a successful build. Concurrently, the user also reported that recent code changes were not reflecting on their server and previously created employee data was missing, indicating a deployment issue. The AI engineer concluded by ensuring all recent code changes were properly committed into a single, comprehensive Git commit and provided the user with clear  instructions for deployment. The application is now successfully compiling and fully functional with all requested features.
