The AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates an iterative, problem-solving approach to developing a canteen management system. Starting with foundational features, the engineer progressively implemented complex requests such as department-specific admin panels, employee order history, dynamic pricing, and a sophisticated breakfast ordering system. Key challenges included backend logic for order management, database synchronization, environment configuration ( issues for local vs. preview), and critical frontend UI/UX bugs like incorrect price calculations and non-persistent orders. The engineer consistently debugged issues, often with  or  for environment-specific problems, and addressed user feedback by enhancing existing features (e.g., unified menu management, admin settings) and fixing bugs across both frontend and backend. The latest efforts involved refining breakfast ordering, fixing balance displays, and resolving persistent UI rendering errors, culminating in a backend that passes all tests.

<product_requirements>
The goal is a comprehensive in-house canteen management system for four Wachabteilung in Germany, with prices in Euro. Each department requires password-protected access and an admin user to manage prices, menus, and employees. Features include:
*   Basic department cards (A, B, C, D, later 1, 2, 3, 4).
*   Employee order history.
*   Admin-set dynamic lunch pricing.
*   Detailed breakfast ordering with roll halves and explicit topping assignments.
*   Breakfast summary tables with shopping lists and employee details.
*   Admin debt management (mark paid, reset).
*   Master Password for developer access.
*   Department password change.
*   Consolidated menu/price management.
*   Order editing and deletion for employees/admins.
*   Enhanced UI/UX with responsiveness, global padding, and specific button changes.
*   Critical fixes for pricing errors, authentication, order persistence, and environment compatibility.
*   Upcoming major change: Each department to operate independently with its own products/prices.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a persistent set of critical bugs reported by the user, particularly concerning the breakfast ordering workflow and UI display.

1.  **Breakfast Order Price Calculation**: The engineer re-fixed the pricing, confirming that admin-set prices are applied directly as per-half-roll values, not divided by two. This involved adjustments in both  and .
2.  **Order Re-editing and Single Booking Constraint**: The logic for employees to edit their single daily breakfast order was refined in , ensuring existing orders load and are editable, and preventing new bookings if one already exists. Corresponding  endpoint for order updates was added in .
3.  **Balance (Saldo) Display**: The frontend logic in  was modified to only display an employee's balance if it is greater than zero, addressing the issue of balances showing even with no active orders.
4.  **Breakfast Overview Errors**: The engineer identified an  error in the  component (), indicating an object is being rendered directly. This fix is currently under investigation.
5.  **Backend Testing**: A comprehensive backend test was just executed, confirming that price calculation, single breakfast order constraint, balance updates on deletion, and order update/re-editing are all working correctly from the backend perspective (100% pass rate).

The current state is that all backend logic for these recent fixes is verified, but the frontend UI for the breakfast overview still has a known rendering issue.

<optional_next_step>
Ask the user for permission to proceed with frontend testing to verify the UI fixes for price calculation, order re-editing, and balance display, and to further debug the breakfast overview rendering error.
