The AI engineer systematically addressed a series of critical bug fixes and new feature implementations, progressing the application significantly. Initially, the focus was on rectifying a severe bug in the cancellation logic for drinks and sweets, where negative balances were incorrectly compounded. This involved precise code analysis and modification within . Following this, a significant feature for time-based order cancellation was implemented, restricting employee cancellations to the order day while maintaining unlimited admin rights, requiring both backend validation and frontend UI adjustments. The next major task involved building a new Statistik tab in the admin dashboard for a comprehensive balance overview. This feature underwent several iterations, starting with basic implementation, then compaction, followed by responsive design fixes for mobile overlaps, addressing long names, and finally unifying the layout across all screen sizes for consistency and improved readability. Each step involved iterative development, testing, and direct user feedback, showcasing an adaptive full-stack development approach.

<product_requirements>
The application is a canteen management system for German fire department employees, facilitating meal, drink, and sweets ordering with administrative and financial controls. Key existing features include master password, order cancellation, flexible payment, robust sponsoring, department-specific pricing, automatic UI updates, custom modals, responsive landing page, mobile state retention, negative withdrawals in admin dashboards, app version display, and PayPal integration.

The work within this trajectory involved:
1.  **Cancellation Logic Bug Fix:** Resolve an issue where cancelling drinks or sweets orders resulted in the balance becoming more negative (e.g., -1.20€ becoming -2.40€) instead of being restored to 0€.
2.  **Time-Based Cancellation:** Implement a restriction allowing employees to cancel their orders only until 23:59 Berlin time on the same day the order was placed. Administrators retain the ability to cancel orders without any time restrictions. This requires frontend (button visibility) and backend (validation) changes.
3.  **Statistics Tab:** Create a new Statistik tab in the admin dashboard. This tab should display a read-only overview of all employees' current balances (Breakfast/Lunch, Drinks/Sweets, Total), sorted by normal employees then guests, with visual separation, and without any action buttons. This tab's layout needed to be compact, responsive across devices (initially list-like for mobile, then unified vertical layout for all), and handle long employee names gracefully.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central API logic, database operations, and business rules.
    -   **Changes Summary**:
        -   **Cancellation Bug Fix**: Corrected the logic in DELETE routes (lines ~2327 and ~3069) for employee and department admin order cancellations. The  for drinks/sweets was stored as negative, so the fix changed addition () to subtraction () to correctly restore the balance.
        -   **Time-Based Cancellation**: Added time validation logic to the employee-specific  endpoint. Introduced  helper function (around line 3245) to check if an order's creation time is before 23:59 Berlin time on the current day.
        -   **New API Endpoint**: Added a GET endpoint  (around line 3282) to expose the cancellation status to the frontend.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React application, UI, state management, API calls.
    -   **Changes Summary**:
        -   **UI Bug Fix ()**: Corrected  function (line 619) to remove redundant minus sign.
        -   **Time-Based Cancellation**: Implemented  function (around line 382) to determine if a delete button should be displayed based on the order's creation time and the backend's helper function. The Löschen button in employee history (around lines 610-639) is now conditionally rendered.
        -   **Statistics Tab Implementation**:
            -   Added a new Statistik tab (around line 2780) in the Admin Dashboard navigation.
            -   Created and integrated the  component (defined around line 6250) to display employee balances.
            -   Implemented employee sorting (normal vs. guest), guest styling, and color-coded balances (green/red/gray).
            -   **Layout Iterations**:
                -   Initially, a compact grid layout was implemented.
                -   Adjusted card sizing, font, and spacing for greater density (lines ~6250-6290).
                -   Modified grid classes () to display more cards per row on larger screens.
                -   Fixed mobile layout overlaps by changing to a list-like, vertical display for individual employee statistics (name on top, balances below).
                -   Resolved long name display issues on mobile using  for names and ensuring vertical separation of name and balances.
                -   **Unified Layout**: Applied the vertical layout (name with truncation, labels, balances) consistently across all screen sizes, while retaining responsive grid for the number of cards per row.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes Summary**: No recent changes in the trajectory, but previously updated .

-   None. All previously identified features, improvements, and reported bugs within this trajectory have been successfully addressed, implemented, and verified by testing or user confirmation by the AI engineer. The user's manual verification for the time-based cancellation logic is pending for tomorrow.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was working on refining the display of employee balances within the newly implemented Statistik tab of the Admin Dashboard. The user reported issues with the previously implemented compact card layout on mobile devices, specifically concerning overlaps and suggesting a list-like display.

The AI engineer addressed this in several stages:
1.  Initially, the mobile layout was adjusted to be a single-column list-like structure, moving away from compact cards on small screens.
2.  Following this, the user reported that longer employee names still caused display problems. The engineer then implemented a vertical layout for each employee's statistics entry, placing the name (with truncation to handle long names) at the top and the three balance types below, uniformly distributed.
3.  Finally, the user requested this improved vertical layout to be applied consistently across *all* screen sizes, not just mobile. The AI engineer unified the design within the  component in  (lines ~6250-6310), ensuring that each employee's statistics are displayed with their (truncated) name above their three balance types, regardless of screen size. The responsive grid still adjusts the *number* of these employee entries per row (from 1 on mobile up to 8 on XL screens). This ensures clear readability and proper handling of long names across all devices.
