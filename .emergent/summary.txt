The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized a canteen management system, primarily focusing on the complex Meal Sponsoring feature. Initial efforts addressed UI/UX and core functionalities, but the bulk of the work involved persistent debugging of the sponsoring module. Key challenges included: a recurring 5€ discrepancy in the Admin Dashboard, incorrect sponsor balance calculations (double-counting), erroneous frontend display (strikethrough on non-sponsored items, missing sponsor details), a critical bug where sponsored items vanished from the shopping list, and a hardcoded date validation preventing testing.

The AI engineer employed iterative debugging, including creating specific utility scripts and repeatedly testing backend logic. After multiple attempts to patch the existing flawed logic, a strategic decision was made to rebuild the sponsoring logic from scratch, which ultimately resolved several deep-seated issues. The final phase focused on preparing the application for a multi-tenant deployment, addressing CORS issues, and providing detailed Apache2 configurations, environment variable setup, and a comprehensive deployment guide for future instances.

The canteen management system aims to streamline breakfast, drinks, and sweets ordering for German fire department employees.
1.  **UI/UX Enhancements**: Implement intuitive / quantity buttons, acoustic order confirmations (with admin toggle), custom success animations, remove employee card balance displays, refine Weißes Brötchen to Helles Brötchen, and standardize all currency displays to X.XX €.
2.  **History Refinements**: Consolidate employee Order History and Payment History into a single, chronologically sorted, paginated view (max 10 entries/page) in the Employee Dashboard.
3.  **Order Cancellation**: Enable soft cancellation of orders by employees, displaying them as Storniert (red, struck-through) with auditor information, and ensuring correct saldo adjustments.
4.  **Meal Sponsoring (Admin Dashboard)**: Allow admins to sponsor either breakfast (excluding coffee) or lunch for selected employees for a given day. This requires:
    *   Transferring the total sponsored cost to the sponsor's balance.
    *   Marking sponsored orders as 0€ for the recipients.
    *   Adding an audit entry for sponsored orders with detailed breakdowns.
    *   Utilizing a user-friendly modal for sponsor selection.
    *   Accurate display of sponsored messages and strikethrough styling in employee history.
    *   Ensuring the Admin Dashboard's daily summary correctly reflects costs without double-counting.
    *   Implementing security (sponsoring only for today/yesterday) and a confirmation dialog.
    *   Mobile optimization for Admin Dashboard elements.
    *   **Resolved Bug**: Corrected a critical bug where sponsored breakfast orders were missing from the shopping list/statistics.
    *   **Resolved Bug**: Fixed date validation to use current Berlin timezone for 'today'/'yesterday'.
    *   **Resolved Bug**: Implemented a cleanup endpoint for failed sponsorings.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central for all API logic, database interactions, and the complex meal sponsoring feature.
    -   **Changes**:
        -    endpoint: Completely refactored and iteratively debugged to correctly calculate sponsor balance (sponsor pays own meal + sponsored for others), accurately deduct sponsored costs from other employees, exclude coffee from breakfast sponsoring, ensure only lunch items are sponsored for lunch, and add audit trails and sponsored messages. Critical fixes for double-counting, floating-point errors, original order price inconsistencies, and  synchronization with .
        -    and  function: Modified to accurately reflect the balance effect of sponsoring and prevent double-counting sponsored meals in the Admin Dashboard's total and individual employee summaries. Corrected logic to ensure sponsored orders are included in shopping list statistics but their financial impact is correctly zeroed out for recipients.
        -   : Added to facilitate testing by cleaning orders and resetting employee balances.
        -   : A new endpoint added to specifically clear out failed or incomplete sponsoring attempts for a given date.
        -   Date validation for sponsoring was updated to use current Berlin local time () for 'today'/'yesterday' checks.
        -   Logic improved to prevent re-sponsoring already sponsored meals and to ensure detailed sponsor messages in order history.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing UI, state, authentication, and core application logic.
    -   **Changes**:
        -    integrated into  (within ) for sponsor selection.
        -    updated with confirmation dialogs.
        -   UI label Sponsoring changed to Ausgeben.
        -    and : Updated to correctly display sponsored messages and apply strikethrough styling only to the relevant sponsored items (excluding coffee), fixing a bug where non-sponsored items were also struck through.
        -   Admin Dashboard (): Mobile optimization for daily summary and improved display of sponsored activity.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  updated to include new subdomains (e.g., ) and  for local testing.  and  updated for multi-tenant deployment.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  updated to a generic subdomain URL (e.g., ).  set to 443 for HTTPS.
-   **, , **:
    -   **Importance**: Utility scripts created during debugging to manage database state and inspect data for troubleshooting persistent bugs.
    -   **Changes**: Created/modified during the trajectory to aid in development and testing.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New file created to provide a comprehensive step-by-step guide for deploying the application to new subdomains, especially for multi-tenant setups. Includes Apache2 configurations, environment variable setup, and troubleshooting.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New file created as a template for setting up environment variables for new deployments, with generic placeholders and clear instructions.

<current_work>
The AI engineer successfully resolved all critical bugs related to the Meal Sponsoring feature and prepared the application for a multi-tenant deployment.
The key issues addressed include:
1.  **Sponsor Balance Calculation**: Fixed double-counting, ensuring the sponsor's balance correctly reflects their own meal cost plus the cost for sponsored individuals (e.g., 27.50€ instead of 32.50€ for a specific test case). This involved a complete rebuild of the sponsoring logic within .
2.  **Admin Dashboard Daily Summary**: Corrected the  calculation in  to accurately display positive revenue (e.g., 40.00€ instead of -20.00€), ensuring sponsored meals are accounted for without double-counting.
3.  **Frontend Display Issues**: Fixed incorrect strikethrough styling in employee history (only sponsored meals are struck through) and implemented detailed sponsor messages with cost breakdowns in the sponsor's order history.
4.  **Shopping List Integrity**: Resolved a critical bug where sponsored breakfast orders vanished from the Frühstück Übersicht (shopping list), ensuring all orders contribute to the shopping list regardless of sponsoring status.
5.  **Date Validation**: Corrected the sponsoring date validation to use the current Berlin timezone, making the today/yesterday logic functional.
6.  **Sponsoring Cleanup**: Added a new API endpoint () and corresponding logic to clear partially failed sponsoring entries, allowing for fresh attempts.

Additionally, the AI engineer addressed deployment challenges for a multi-tenant setup, providing:
-   Updated  files (backend and frontend) with generic placeholders for database and URLs.
-   A comprehensive  guide detailing step-by-step instructions for deploying to new subdomains using Apache2 (including specific configurations for , , ,  services, and ).
-   An  file for easy configuration replication.
The system is now considered stable, fully functional, and production-ready for multi-tenant deployment.
