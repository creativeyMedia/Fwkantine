The trajectory details an iterative development process by the AI engineer focusing on a canteen management system. The engineer began by taking on a new set of user requirements covering mobile reload behavior, a sponsoring display bug, flexible payments (deposit/withdrawal), and app version display. This involved significant modifications to  and  to correctly handle state, API calls, and data persistence. Subsequent phases addressed new feature requests like PayPal integration (including backend models and frontend UI with URL normalization) and a daily lunch price reset. Throughout, the process was heavily bug-driven, with the engineer diagnosing and fixing issues such as React hook errors, backend API conflicts, incorrect data filtering in the frontend, and logic flaws in the sponsoring mechanism. The work culminated in a robust Doppel-Sponsoring-Schutz and comprehensive UI/UX refinements, with all features deemed production-ready, awaiting a user fork for further instructions.

<product_requirements>
The application is a canteen management system for German fire department employees, streamlining meal, drink, and sweets ordering. Key functional requirements and implemented features include:

1.  **Core Functionality**: Master Password, Order Cancellation Documentation, Flexible Payment System (with separate accounts and chronological history), Payment Protection, and UI/UX Refinements (e.g., consistent saldo colors, pagination, custom modals).
2.  **Sponsoring Logic Correction**: Correctly credits sponsored employees and debits sponsors for all meal types, ensuring visibility of sponsored meals in the overview (not disappearing).
3.  **Department-specific Pricing**: Ability for each department to set its own prices for items like eggs and coffee.
4.  **Automatic UI Updates**: Prices and balances refresh automatically after changes.
5.  **Custom Modals**: Replace  with custom success/error notifications.
6.  **Landing Page**: A modern, responsive promotional website (creation initiated, but CSS loading issue pending).
7.  **Mobile Reload Behavior**: Application should remember the last department/dashboard and not reset to the global start screen upon reload.
8.  **Ein-/Auszahlung Extension**: Allow negative amounts for withdrawals in the admin dashboard, with corresponding display changes.
9.  **App Version Display**: Show App-Version 1.1.2 in the Admin Dashboard under department information.
10. **PayPal Integration**: Add Pay with PayPal buttons to the employee dashboard, configurable by admins with separate or combined links for breakfast/drinks, including URL normalization.
11. **Daily Lunch Price Reset**: Initialize the daily lunch price to 0‚Ç¨ at the start of a new day, without affecting previous days.
12. **UI/UX Refinements**: K√∂rnerbr√∂tchen crossed out on sponsoring, move Abteilungs-Information below PayPal settings, change Fr√ºhst√ºck tab to Fr√ºhst√ºck/Mittag, and auto-scroll to top on page/tab change.
13. **Sponsoring Robustness**: Support for sponsors without own orders, prevent already sponsored message on failed attempts.
14. **Database & Support Info**: Add daily backup details and support contact email to Abteilungs-Information.
15. **Double Sponsoring Prevention**: Block Ausgeben buttons in the UI if a meal (breakfast/lunch) has already been sponsored for the day, showing who sponsored it.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented and verified the Doppel-Sponsoring-Schutz feature across all relevant administration dashboards. This feature prevents accidental double-sponsoring of meals by dynamically checking the sponsoring status for a given date and meal type. If a meal (breakfast or lunch) has already been sponsored, the UI elements (dropdowns, buttons) for sponsoring that specific meal are blocked, and an informative message is displayed, including the name of the employee who already sponsored it. This was implemented in the , , and the .

The backend was extended with a new API endpoint () to provide this status. The frontend now fetches this status dynamically and uses conditional rendering to update the UI accordingly. After resolving an issue where the  buttons were not initially blocked, the feature is now fully functional and provides immediate visual feedback to the administrator. The user has acknowledged that the application is in a gut funktionierende verson mti noch kleinen bug und anpassungen and plans to fork the repository before giving new instructions. All features requested within this trajectory have been implemented and validated by the AI engineer through backend testing.
