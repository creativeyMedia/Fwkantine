The AI engineer systematically addressed a comprehensive set of user requirements, transitioning the application from a bug-ridden MVP to a robust, feature-rich system. The work began with initial fixes for display issues, debug functionalities, and CSS loading, followed by the successful resolution of a complex breakfast topping assignment bug. Subsequently, the engineer implemented three major features: Fried Eggs (Spiegeleier), an Extras + Sonderwünsche (Notes) field, and an Is Guest marker for employees, along with a visual separation on employee dashboards. This development was characterized by an iterative full-stack approach, tackling numerous follow-up bugs, including React infinite loops, CORS issues, display formatting errors, duplication problems, and sponsoring calculation discrepancies. Each fix involved meticulous analysis, targeted code modifications in  and , and verification, ultimately leading to a stable and fully functional application as confirmed by extensive testing and user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The application is a canteen management system for German fire department employees, supporting meal, drink, and sweets ordering with administrative and financial controls. Key features include a master password, order cancellation, flexible payment, robust sponsoring logic, department-specific pricing, automatic UI updates, custom modals, a responsive landing page, mobile state retention, negative withdrawals in admin dashboards, app version display, and PayPal integration. Prior work fixed bugs in drinks/sweets order storage, breakfast topping assignments, debug features, and landing page CSS.

New requirements involved:
1.  **Spiegeleier (Fried Eggs):** Introduce as an orderable item, mirroring Gekochte Frühstückseier in pricing, order modal, history, sponsoring, statistics, and admin price management.
2.  **Extras + Sonderwünsche (Notes) Field:** A free-text field in the order modal, stored with the order, and displayed in the employee dashboard history, admin orders, and specifically at the bottom of the breakfast overview's shopping list, before detailed employee orders.
3.  **Guest Marker for Employees:** A checkbox during new employee creation to mark them as a guest (). This marker is used to sort employees in the main employee dashboard (normal employees first, then a visual separator, then guests) and the admin dashboard, without affecting ordering or payment functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer successfully resolved a UI display bug reported by the user concerning duplicate minus signs ( instead of ) in the employee transaction history.

The issue was identified within the  function in . Specifically, line 619 was manually prepending a minus sign to a value that was already correctly formatted as negative for debit transactions (e.g., ). This resulted in the redundant double minus ().

The fix involved updating the display logic in  at line 619:
**Original:** 
**Corrected:** 
This modification ensures that the output of  (which already provides the correct sign) is displayed directly. The frontend service was restarted, and subsequent testing confirmed the bug was fully eliminated across all transaction types, providing a clean and professional display of financial values in the employee history.
