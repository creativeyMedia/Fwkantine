The AI engineer has demonstrated a comprehensive full-stack development capability, iteratively addressing complex requirements and bug fixes. The work began with critical bug resolutions, including a negative balance cancellation issue and time-based order cancellations. The primary focus then shifted to a significant new feature: a multi-department sub-account system for canteen employees. This involved extensive backend modifications to data models, API endpoints for order creation, deletion, and payment, ensuring sub-account balances are correctly managed and isolated. Concurrently, the frontend was adapted with new UI elements, differentiated employee profile views, and responsive modal designs. Several rounds of user feedback led to continuous refinements in UI consistency, data filtering (e.g., history views, breakfast orders), and critical bug fixes in balance calculations and sponsoring logic. The most recent task involves moving the temporary employee persistence from client-side  to a server-side solution to enable cross-device functionality, which is currently in progress.

The application is a canteen management system for German fire department employees, managing meal, drink, and sweets orders with administrative controls. The system needs to evolve to support a multi-department model where employees belong to a Stamm-Wachabteilung (home department) but can also order as temporary members in other departments.

Key requirements and implemented features include:
1.  **Unified Employee ID:** A single database entry per person, usable across all four Wachabteilungen.
2.  **Four Separate Accounts per Employee:** Each employee will have a main account for their home department and three sub-accounts, one for each of the other departments. These accounts track Breakfast/Lunch and Drinks/Sweets balances separately.
3.  **Temporary Employee Feature:**
    *   Department admins can temporarily add employees from other departments via a dropdown for the current day (until 23:59 Berlin time).
    *   These Gastabteilung-Mitarbeiter can place orders, which are booked to their respective sub-accounts.
    *   Orders placed by temporary employees can be cancelled on the same day.
    *   Temporary employees automatically disappear from the list after the day ends.
    *   The feature needs to work across devices (server-side persistence).
4.  **Differentiated UI Display:**
    *   **Employee Profile (Stamm-Wachabteilung):** Shows main balances prominently and all sub-account balances compactly in a single row with full labels (Fr√ºhst√ºck, Getr√§nke, Gesamt). History shows all orders with department markings.
    *   **Employee Profile (Gast-Wachabteilung):** Only shows the sub-account saldo for the current guest department. History only shows orders made in that specific guest tour.
    *   All four department balances are displayed separately.
5.  **Admin Dashboard Andere WA Tab:** A new tab to overview and manage temporary employees' sub-account bookings, including a balance overview per sub-account and the ability to manage (add/deduct) balances. Only Stamm-Tour-admins can delete.
6.  **Full Booking & Sponsoring Functionality:** All existing booking features (Breakfast, Lunch, toppings) and the sponsoring system must fully integrate and function with the new sub-account structure, ensuring bookings and sponsorships correctly affect the designated main or sub-accounts.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains all API logic, database interactions, and core business rules.
    -   **Changes Summary**:
        -   **Employee Model Update**:  Pydantic model extended with  to store balances for other departments (JSON-based).
        -   **Balance Update Logic**: Modified , , and  to conditionally update either main balances (for home department orders) or only specific sub-account balances (for guest department orders).
        -   **Sponsoring Logic Update**: Modified  to update the relevant sub-account balance in addition to main balances for sponsored orders.
        -   **Sub-account Management Endpoints**: Added  and  for flexible balance adjustments and resets specific to sub-accounts.
        -   **Pydantic Model Enhancements**:  extended to handle  and  for sub-account payments.  model adjusted for new fields.
        -   **System Reset Endpoint**: Added  to clear all orders, payment logs, and reset all employee balances (main and sub-accounts) to 0.
        -   **Temporary Employee Persistence (In Progress)**: New logic and endpoints are being added to manage temporary employee associations in the database for cross-device functionality.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React application, managing UI, state, and API calls.
    -   **Changes Summary**:
        -   **Individual Employee Profile ()**: Enhanced to fetch and display main balances prominently and all sub-account balances compactly, differentiated for Stammwachabteilung (home) vs. Gastwachabteilung (guest) views. Layout was refined for three sub-accounts in a row and compact Fr√ºhst√ºck / Getr√§nke display.
        -   **History Filtering**:  function was adapted to filter order history based on whether the employee is viewed as a temporary guest (only guest department orders) or a home employee (all orders with department tags).
        -   **Andere WA + Modal (Temporary Employee Addition)**: Transformed from a simple dropdown to a full-fledged, responsive modal with an 'X' button, overlay close functionality, and improved mobile display. It now fetches other department employees.
        -   **Admin Dashboard ()**: New Andere WA tab added to the navigation.
        -   ** Component**: Created to display employees with sub-account bookings. Integrated with the unified  for balance management and  (now being replaced by server-side) for temporary employee persistence.
        -   **Unified Payment Modal ()**: Extended to handle both main account and sub-account balance management, replacing a separate .
        -   **Breakfast Order Bug Fix**: Modified  and  to filter breakfast orders by the *current department ID*, preventing guest breakfast orders from appearing in the home department's modal.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's report that temporarily added guest employees were not persistent across devices. The previous implementation used , which is client-side only.

The current work involves:
1.  **Backend Changes ():** The AI engineer has initiated changes to create a server-side solution for temporary employee persistence. This includes adding new backend endpoints and logic to manage the association of temporary employees with departments in the database.
2.  **Frontend Changes ():** The next step, after backend changes, will be to update the frontend to use these new server-side APIs for adding, retrieving, and removing temporary employees, replacing the  approach.

The AI engineer has already made initial edits to  to support this, and then  to start integrating the new server-side logic, and the last action was to begin testing both solutions. This is a critical step to ensure that the temporary employee feature works reliably and consistently, regardless of the device used by the administrator.
