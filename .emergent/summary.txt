The AI engineer's trajectory focused heavily on critical bug fixes and establishing a robust, stable deployment environment for the canteen management system. Initially, deployment issues prevented recent changes from reflecting, followed by a major data persistence bug where all newly created data (employees, orders, passwords) vanished on server refresh due to the frontend communicating with a preview environment instead of the live server. This was resolved by correcting  in .

Subsequently, menu items (toppings, drinks, sweets) also failed to save, stemming from a misconfigured API base URL in  that reverted to relative paths in production. Another critical issue arose with department IDs, initially UUIDs, which led to data inconsistencies and orphaned menu items when  generated new departments. The solution involved refactoring  to use fixed, readable department IDs (), creating migration/cleanup endpoints (later removed for a clean build strategy), and ensuring the correct  and  () were used in the production backend. The final state involves a clean, production-ready build with stable IDs, and proper environment separation.

The goal is an in-house canteen management system for four German Wachabteilung (departments) with Euro-based pricing, password-protected access, and admin roles for managing prices, menus, and employees. Features include: department cards, employee order history, dynamic lunch pricing, detailed breakfast ordering with roll halves and explicit topping assignments, a matrix-style breakfast summary for kitchen staff, and boiled breakfast eggs with quantity selection.

Key fixes and enhancements throughout development included:
- **Deployment & Persistence:** Ensuring all data (employees, bookings, password changes) persists correctly on the live server, resolving frontend communication with preview environments, and fixing API URL logic.
- **Environment Separation:** Establishing distinct development (Emergent) and production (user's server) environments with separate database configurations.
- **Data Integrity:** Addressing menu item persistence (toppings, drinks, sweets) and fixing errors in breakfast order saving.
- **Stable Department IDs:** Replacing unstable UUIDs for departments with fixed, readable IDs (e.g., ) to ensure consistent data referencing across the system.
- **Password Management:** Ensuring admin and employee password changes are saved persistently without being reset by initialization logic.
- **UI/UX Refinements:** (Mentioned in initial summary) Correcting Euro sign placement, simplifying topping creation, improving lunch display, flexible breakfast orders, drag-and-drop employee sorting.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was finalizing a comprehensive solution for critical data persistence and environment separation issues. The main challenges were that:
1.  Frontend was incorrectly configured (), causing API calls to a preview environment or failing due to relative paths.
2.  Department IDs were being generated as dynamic UUIDs, leading to data inconsistencies (e.g., menu items becoming orphaned) when default data was re-initialized.
3.  The development environment in Emergent was interacting with the user's live database, causing unintended changes and data resets on the user's server.

The AI engineer addressed these by:
-   Correcting the  logic in  and ensuring correct  configuration for both development () and production ().
-   Refactoring  to use fixed, human-readable department IDs (e.g., ) instead of UUIDs, and ensuring  respects existing department data.
-   Establishing a clear separation of development and production database names ( for Emergent,  for user's live server), including restoring the user's original  with authentication.
-   Creating , , and  to guide a clean deployment.
-   Removing temporary migration/cleanup endpoints from the final build to ensure a clean codebase.

The system is now stable in the development environment with all APIs tested and confirmed to work with fixed department IDs. A clean build is ready for deployment to the user's server, with explicit instructions for ,  setup, and a one-time database cleanup to align with the new fixed ID strategy.
