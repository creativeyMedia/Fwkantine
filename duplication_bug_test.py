🚨 CRITICAL DUPLICATION BUG FIX TEST: Test employee duplication fix in daily overview

CRITICAL DUPLICATION BUG TEST:

1. **Create Test Scenario:**
   - Create 3 employees: Employee1, Employee2, Employee3
   - Employee1: Create breakfast order (rolls, eggs, coffee, lunch)
   - Employee2: Create breakfast order (rolls, eggs, coffee, lunch)  
   - Employee3: Create NO ORDERS (will be sponsor only)

2. **Test Mixed Sponsoring:**
   - Employee1 sponsors breakfast for Employee2 (Employee1 has both own orders AND sponsors)
   - Employee3 sponsors lunch for Employee2 (Employee3 has no own orders, only sponsors)

3. **CRITICAL Bug Test - Check for Duplicates:**
   - Call GET /api/orders/breakfast-history/{department_id}
   - CRITICAL: Each employee should appear ONLY ONCE in employee_orders
   - Employee1: Should show own orders + sponsored_breakfast info (NO DUPLICATE)
   - Employee2: Should show own orders with sponsored meal adjustments (NO DUPLICATE)
   - Employee3: Should show empty orders + sponsored_lunch info (NO DUPLICATE)

4. **Verify Correct Structure:**
   - Employee1: Has own order items + sponsored_breakfast data + correct total_amount
   - Employee2: Has own order items + correct remaining total_amount after sponsoring
   - Employee3: Has zero order items + sponsored_lunch data + sponsored total_amount

5. **Count Verification:**
   - Total employees in employee_orders should equal 3 (not 4, 5, or 6)
   - No employee names should be duplicated
   - All sponsoring information should be correctly assigned

EXPECTED RESULT: 
- NO employee duplicates in daily overview
- Each employee appears exactly once with correct sponsoring information
- Sponsor totals calculated correctly without duplication
