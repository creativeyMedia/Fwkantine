ADMIN DASHBOARD DAILY SUMMARY DOUBLE-COUNTING TEST

FOCUS: Test the corrected admin dashboard daily summary to eliminate double-counting of sponsored meals.

**CRITICAL BUG FIXED:**
The admin dashboard was showing sponsored meals twice - once for the original orderer and once for the sponsor, 
leading to inflated totals (80€ instead of 30€).

**FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**
1. **Individual Employee Orders**: Sponsored employees now show only non-sponsored parts
   - Breakfast sponsored: Hide rolls/eggs, show coffee/lunch
   - Lunch sponsored: Hide lunch, show breakfast/coffee
2. **Breakfast Summary**: Overall totals now exclude sponsored items to prevent double-counting
3. **Sponsor Orders**: Sponsors show their full order (including sponsored details)

**TEST SCENARIO:**
1. Create 3 employees in Department 3 with breakfast + lunch orders
2. Each orders: 2€ breakfast + 5€ lunch + 1€ coffee = 8€ total
3. Employee 3 sponsors lunch for all (should pay 3×5€ = 15€ extra)
4. **VERIFICATION**: Admin dashboard daily summary should show:
   - Employee 1: 2€ breakfast + 1€ coffee = 3€ (lunch sponsored)
   - Employee 2: 2€ breakfast + 1€ coffee = 3€ (lunch sponsored) 
   - Employee 3: 2€ breakfast + 5€ lunch + 1€ coffee + 15€ sponsored = 23€
   - **TOTAL**: 3€ + 3€ + 23€ = 29€ (NOT 39€ with double-counting)

**CRITICAL VERIFICATION:**
- NO double-counting in daily summary totals
- Sponsored employees show only non-sponsored items
- Overall breakfast summary excludes sponsored items
- Sponsor shows full breakdown including sponsored costs

**Use Department 3:**
- Admin: admin3
- Focus on daily summary accuracy
- Verify total amounts match actual costs paid
