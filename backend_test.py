5€ DISCREPANCY FIX VERIFICATION TEST

FOCUS: Test the FIXED daily summary calculation for sponsored meals to verify the 5€ discrepancy has been resolved.

**CRITICAL BUG FIXED:**
The /api/orders/breakfast-history/{department_id} endpoint was double-counting sponsor orders by adding 
the full sponsor order total_price (which includes both sponsor's own cost + sponsored costs for others) 
instead of only the sponsor's own cost.

**FIX IMPLEMENTED:**
Modified lines 1240-1242 and 1297-1299 in server.py to handle sponsor orders correctly by calculating 
'sponsor_own_cost = total_price - sponsor_total_cost' for sponsor orders. This ensures sponsored costs 
are not double-counted in the daily summary while maintaining correct individual employee balances.

**TEST SCENARIO (Exact user report):**
1. Create 5 employees who order lunch (5×5€ = 25€) 
2. Create 1 employee who orders breakfast with an egg (0.50€)
3. Sponsor the lunch for all 5 employees using one of them as sponsor
4. **VERIFICATION**: Daily summary total_amount should show correct 25.50€ instead of previous 30.50€ (5€ extra)
5. Verify individual employee balances still work correctly (sponsored employees show €0.00, sponsor shows correct amount)
6. Compare breakfast-history endpoint with daily-summary endpoint to ensure they now match

**CRITICAL VERIFICATION:**
- Daily summary shows 25.50€ (NOT 30.50€ with 5€ extra)
- Breakfast-history endpoint matches daily-summary endpoint
- Individual employee balances are correct
- No double-counting of sponsor costs in total_amount calculation

**Use Department 3:**
- Admin: admin3
- Focus on exact user scenario recreation
- Verify the specific 5€ discrepancy is eliminated
