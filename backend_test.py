PAYMENT PROTECTION SYSTEM TESTING

**PAYMENT PROTECTION SYSTEM TESTING**

Test the new payment protection system that prevents order cancellation after payments to maintain balance integrity.

**PAYMENT PROTECTION LOGIC:**
- Orders placed BEFORE a payment cannot be cancelled by employees
- Orders placed AFTER a payment can be cancelled normally  
- Admin cancellations are not restricted (admins can override)
- Cancellation = refund (balance increases)

**TEST SCENARIOS:**

1. **Setup Clean Employee**: Create test employee with 0.00 balance
2. **Create Initial Order**: Place breakfast order (should create debt, e.g., -5.50€)
3. **Make Payment**: Pay amount (e.g., 20.00€, balance becomes +14.50€)
4. **Test Protection - Order Before Payment**: 
   - Try to cancel the initial order (placed before payment)
   - Should FAIL with error about payment protection
5. **Create New Order After Payment**: Place another order after payment
6. **Test Normal Cancellation - Order After Payment**:
   - Try to cancel the new order (placed after payment)
   - Should SUCCEED and refund correctly
7. **Verify Balance Calculations**:
   - Cancellation should INCREASE balance (refund logic)
   - No more `max(0, balance)` constraints
8. **Admin Override Test**: Admin should be able to cancel protected orders

**EXPECTED RESULTS:**
- Initial order (before payment): Cancellation BLOCKED ❌
- New order (after payment): Cancellation ALLOWED ✅  
- Balance increases with cancellation (refund behavior)
- Clear error message for payment protection violations
- Timestamp-based protection working correctly

**API ENDPOINTS TO TEST:**
- `DELETE /api/employee/{employee_id}/orders/{order_id}` (should respect protection)
- `DELETE /api/department-admin/orders/{order_id}` (admin override)

**CRITICAL VERIFICATION:**
- Payment protection prevents balance manipulation
- Refund logic works correctly (balance increases on cancellation)
- Timestamp comparison logic functions properly
- German error messages are clear and helpful

Use Department "2. Wachabteilung" for testing.
