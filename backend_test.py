🚨 CRITICAL FRONTEND DISPLAY BUG TEST: Test chronological history display fixes for combined sponsoring

FOCUS ON FRONTEND DISPLAY BUGS:

1. **Create Complex Combined Sponsoring Scenario:**
   - Create Employee1: Full breakfast order (rolls, eggs, coffee, lunch) ~€8-10
   - Create Employee2: Will sponsor breakfast for Employee1
   - Create Employee3: Will sponsor lunch for Employee1
   - Result: Employee1 should have both breakfast AND lunch sponsored

2. **Test Combined Sponsoring:**
   - Employee2 sponsors breakfast for Employee1
   - Employee3 sponsors lunch for Employee1  
   - This should create sponsored_meal_type = "breakfast,lunch" for Employee1's order

3. **Critical Frontend Tests - Individual Employee Profile:**
   - Get Employee1's individual profile/chronological history
   - CRITICAL: Check that sponsored items are struck through:
     - Rolls and eggs should be struck through (breakfast sponsored)
     - Lunch should be struck through (lunch sponsored)
     - Coffee should NOT be struck through (never sponsored)
   
4. **Critical Total Display Test:**
   - CRITICAL: calculateDisplayPrice should show only coffee cost (~€1-2)
   - Should NOT show original total cost (~€8-10)
   - Verify total in chronological history matches actual remaining cost

5. **Test sponsored_meal_type Structure:**
   - Verify order has sponsored_meal_type = "breakfast,lunch" or similar
   - Verify sponsored_message contains information about both sponsorings
   - Test that both strikethrough logic and price calculation work

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Struck through: Rolls, eggs, lunch (all sponsored items)
- NOT struck through: Coffee (never sponsored)
- Total display: Only coffee cost (e.g., -€1.50), NOT original cost (e.g., -€8.50)
- Both sponsoring types should be handled correctly in combined scenario
