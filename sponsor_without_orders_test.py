üéØ SPONSOR WITHOUT ORDERS VISIBILITY TEST

This test verifies the sponsoring display fix and sponsors-without-orders visibility:

CRITICAL TEST SCENARIO:
1. Create 3 employees with breakfast orders (rolls, eggs, coffee, lunch)
2. Create 1 sponsor employee with NO OWN ORDERS (important!)
3. Test sponsoring by employee without own orders
4. Test daily overview API - sponsor WITHOUT own orders should appear in employee_orders
5. Test display logic - sponsor should show sponsored_breakfast/sponsored_lunch information
6. Test combined scenario - sponsor both breakfast and lunch using same sponsor without own orders

EXPECTED RESULT: 
- Sponsors without own orders should appear in daily overview with sponsoring information
- All sponsored employees should show sponsored fields correctly
- Frontend should display green sponsoring boxes for sponsors
