# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

(2) BREAKFAST UPDATE CALCULATION FIX: Fixed update_order endpoint to properly calculate boiled_eggs price and correct lunch pricing logic (lunch price per order/total_halves, not per individual roll). (3) RETROACTIVE LUNCH PRICING FIX: Fixed update_lunch_settings to use correct price calculation (no division by 2), proper boiled_eggs handling, and correct lunch price multiplication logic. These fixes address user-reported calculation errors and missing persistence."

Created test orders with has_lunch=true and has_lunch=false, verified daily summary properly tracks lunch status for multiple employees (found 3 employees with has_lunch property, 2 with lunch orders). ✅ 2) Order Creation with Various Combinations - POST /api/orders endpoint successfully handles all order types: only breakfast rolls with toppings (€1.60), only boiled eggs with no rolls (€1.50), only lunch with no rolls/eggs (€0.00). All combinations properly stored and calculated. ✅ 3) Breakfast Status Check - GET /api/breakfast-status/{department_id} endpoint working correctly, returns proper structure with is_closed=false and correct date (2025-08-24). ✅ 4) Complete Order Display - All order types (eggs only, lunch only, rolls only, mixed combinations) properly appear in daily summary. Found multiple order types: boiled_eggs(1), lunch(3), rolls(4) across 6 employees. Shopping list and total boiled eggs tracking (3 eggs) working correctly.

Comprehensive testing revealed that the initialize_default_data() function is still overwriting user-changed passwords despite the fix. Test results: (1) Password change endpoints work correctly - both employee and admin passwords can be changed successfully, (2) Authentication with new passwords works immediately after change, (3) CRITICAL FAILURE: After calling /api/init-data, changed passwords are reset back to default values (e.g., debug_test_password → admin2), (4) This confirms the original user-reported issue still exists - passwords revert after minutes/homepage visits. ROOT CAUSE: The initialize_default_data() function contains logic that should preserve existing passwords (lines 256-260 have correct 'pass' statement), but passwords are still being reset. This suggests either: (a) There's another code path updating departments, (b) The database query logic has an issue, (c) There's some other process interfering. IMPACT: User password changes are not persistent, causing major usability issues. The fix needs further investigation to identify the actual cause of password resets."
