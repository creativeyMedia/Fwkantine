          comment: "IMPLEMENTED: Fixed critical bug where daily overview and shopping list showed '0 Br√∂tchen' instead of actual roll counts, and 'Gesamt' row in breakfast overview table showed '-' instead of totals. ROOT CAUSE: breakfast_summary was only updated within toppings loop, causing roll counts to be missed when no toppings present. BACKEND FIX: Moved breakfast_summary update to always execute after white_halves/seeded_halves calculation. FRONTEND FIX: Updated totals calculation in BreakfastSummaryTable to use new backend format {white: count, seeded: count} instead of proportional distribution. Both roll counts in daily overview and toppings totals in table now display correctly."

This confirms the corrected calculation approach where daily total represents actual food revenue, not cost redistribution totals. ‚úÖ 3) SEPARATED REVENUE VERIFICATION - Breakfast revenue: ‚Ç¨4.40 (rolls only, excluding coffee), Lunch revenue: ‚Ç¨20.00, Total separated: ‚Ç¨24.40. This correctly excludes coffee from revenue statistics while maintaining it in employee balances. ‚úÖ 4) INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE TOTALS CORRECT - After sponsoring: Mit1: ‚Ç¨5.90 (coffee + sponsoring costs), Mit2: ‚Ç¨1.50 (coffee only), Mit3: ‚Ç¨1.50 (coffee only), Mit4: ‚Ç¨21.50 (coffee + sponsoring costs). These reflect actual amounts employees need to pay after cost redistribution. ‚úÖ 5) MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION - Sum of original order prices: ‚Ç¨30.40, Daily total: ‚Ç¨30.40, Sponsoring is cost redistribution not revenue reduction. The system correctly distinguishes between actual revenue (‚Ç¨30.40) and cost redistribution between employees. CRITICAL VERIFICATION: The exact scenario from review request confirms that daily total correctly shows actual food revenue (‚Ç¨30.40), sponsoring is cost redistribution not revenue reduction, and separated revenue excludes coffee (‚Ç¨24.40). The corrected daily total calculation is FULLY FUNCTIONAL."

Different departments have different menu pricing: Department 1 breakfast portion = ‚Ç¨1.70 (0.50 + 0.60 + 0.60), Department 2 breakfast portion = ‚Ç¨2.25 (0.75 + 1.00 + 0.50). ‚úÖ 2) DEPARTMENT 1 VERIFICATION PASSED: Created sponsored employee with ‚Ç¨3.20 order, sponsor sponsors breakfast for ‚Ç¨1.70 (correct breakfast portion), sponsored employee gets exactly ‚Ç¨1.70 refund (balance: -3.20 + 1.70 = -1.50), sponsor pays exactly ‚Ç¨1.70 (balance: 0.00 - 1.70 = -1.70). NO double calculations detected. ‚úÖ 3) DEPARTMENT 2 VERIFICATION PASSED: Created sponsored employee with ‚Ç¨3.25 order, sponsor sponsors breakfast for ‚Ç¨2.25 (correct breakfast portion for dept 2 pricing), sponsored employee gets exactly ‚Ç¨2.25 refund (balance: -3.25 + 2.25 = -1.00), sponsor pays exactly ‚Ç¨2.25 (balance: 0.00 - 2.25 = -2.25). NO double calculations detected. ‚úÖ 4) DOUBLE CALCULATION CHECK CONFIRMED: All balance updates performed exactly ONCE per transaction. Sponsored employees receive correct breakfast portion refunds (rolls + eggs only), sponsors pay correct breakfast portion costs, coffee correctly excluded from sponsoring and remains with employee. ‚úÖ 5) ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The reported double-calculation bug was actually FIXED correctly. The fix removed duplicate balance updates in sponsor_meal endpoint and now uses ONLY update_employee_balance() function for consistency. Balance calculations are mathematically perfect with no double crediting or double charging. ‚úÖ 6) COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION: Tested both scenarios (sponsor with/without own order), verified exact balance calculations match expected values, confirmed different department pricing handled correctly, verified coffee exclusion from breakfast sponsoring. CRITICAL SUCCESS: The sponsoring double-calculation bug fix is FULLY FUNCTIONAL and working perfectly. The system correctly calculates breakfast portions per department, excludes coffee from sponsoring, and performs all balance updates exactly once. NO double calculations exist in the current implementation."

NO double calculations detected. ‚úÖ DOUBLE CALCULATION CHECK CONFIRMED: All balance updates performed exactly ONCE per transaction. Sponsored employees receive correct breakfast portion refunds (rolls + eggs only), sponsors pay correct breakfast portion costs, coffee correctly excluded from sponsoring and remains with employee. ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The reported double-calculation bug was actually FIXED correctly. The fix removed duplicate balance updates in sponsor_meal endpoint and now uses ONLY update_employee_balance() function for consistency. Balance calculations are mathematically perfect with no double crediting or double charging. CRITICAL SUCCESS: The sponsoring double-calculation bug fix is FULLY FUNCTIONAL and working perfectly. The system correctly calculates breakfast portions per department, excludes coffee from sponsoring, and performs all balance updates exactly once. NO double calculations exist in the current implementation."

      message: "üéâ STATISTICS TAB GESAMTSALDI BACKEND SUPPORT FULLY VERIFIED! Comprehensive testing of the backend endpoints supporting the new Gesamtsaldi (total balances) feature in Admin Dashboard Statistics tab completed with 100% success rate (16/16 tests passed): ‚úÖ BACKEND ENDPOINTS WORKING: All critical endpoints verified: GET /api/departments/{id}/employees returns complete employee balance data (45 employees in fw4abteilung1, 32 in fw4abteilung2), GET /api/employees/{id}/profile provides individual employee profiles, GET /api/departments/{id}/employees-with-subaccount-balances returns subaccount data (12 employees with subaccounts in dept1, 11 in dept2). ‚úÖ GESAMTSALDI CALCULATIONS VERIFIED: Mathematical accuracy confirmed for both test departments - Department 1: Fr√ºhst√ºck & Mittagessen total -3.20‚Ç¨, S√º√üigkeiten & Getr√§nke total 0.00‚Ç¨. Department 2: Fr√ºhst√ºck & Mittagessen total -3.25‚Ç¨, S√º√üigkeiten & Getr√§nke total 0.00‚Ç¨. Manual calculations match automated calculations exactly (precision verified to 0.01‚Ç¨). ‚úÖ COLOR CODING LOGIC WORKING: Correct color assignment verified - negative totals display red, zero/positive totals display green. Edge cases tested: 0.00‚Ç¨‚Üígreen, -0.01‚Ç¨‚Üíred, +0.01‚Ç¨‚Üígreen. ‚úÖ DATA STRUCTURE COMPLETE: All 77 employees across both departments have complete balance structure with id, name, breakfast_balance, drinks_sweets_balance, and properly initialized subaccount_balances for all 4 departments. ‚úÖ ADMIN AUTHENTICATION VERIFIED: Both test departments authenticate successfully (admin1/password1 for fw4abteilung1, admin2/password1 for fw4abteilung2). CRITICAL SUCCESS: The backend FULLY SUPPORTS the new Gesamtsaldi feature. Frontend can reliably calculate and display the two total balance boxes: 'Fr√ºhst√ºck & Mittagessen' and 'S√º√üigkeiten & Getr√§nke' with proper color coding (green for positive, red for negative). All backend endpoints provide mathematically accurate data for the Statistics tab total balances calculation."
