5 CRITICAL BUG FIXES TESTING - CANTEEN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Testing the 5 critical bug fixes implemented in the canteen management system:

**Bug 1 & 4 - Breakfast/Lunch Sponsoring Calculation Fixes:**
- Test breakfast sponsoring: Create employees with full breakfast orders (rolls + eggs + coffee + lunch), 
  sponsor breakfast, verify only rolls+eggs are sponsored and coffee+lunch costs remain with employee
- Test lunch sponsoring: Create employees with breakfast+lunch orders, sponsor lunch, 
  verify only lunch costs are sponsored and breakfast+coffee costs remain
- Verify both total_amount calculations and individual employee amounts are correct in daily summaries

**Bug 2 - Department-specific Egg/Coffee Prices:**
- Test new endpoints: GET /api/department-settings/{department_id}, 
  PUT /api/department-settings/{department_id}/boiled-eggs-price, 
  PUT /api/department-settings/{department_id}/coffee-price
- Create orders with eggs/coffee and verify department-specific prices are used instead of global prices
- Test price updates per department and verify other departments are unaffected

**Backend Test Priority:**
1. Department-specific pricing functionality (new endpoints)
2. Sponsoring calculation accuracy (critical for financial correctness)
3. Daily summary calculation accuracy after sponsoring

**Test Scenario:**
Department 2: Create 3 employees, set custom egg price (€0.75) and coffee price (€2.00). 
Create breakfast orders with rolls+eggs+coffee+lunch. Test breakfast sponsoring and verify 
calculations use department prices and only sponsor correct items.
