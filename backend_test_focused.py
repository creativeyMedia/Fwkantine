5‚Ç¨ DISCREPANCY FIX VERIFICATION TEST - FOCUSED ANALYSIS

FOCUS: Analyze existing sponsored meal data to verify the 5‚Ç¨ discrepancy fix is working correctly.

**CRITICAL BUG FIXED:**
The /api/orders/breakfast-history/{department_id} endpoint was double-counting sponsor orders by adding 
the full sponsor order total_price (which includes both sponsor's own cost + sponsored costs for others) 
instead of only the sponsor's own cost.

**FIX VERIFICATION:**
Instead of creating new test data, analyze existing sponsored meal data to verify:
1. Sponsored employees show ‚Ç¨0.00 in breakfast-history endpoint
2. Sponsor employees show correct amounts (not double-counted)
3. Total amounts are calculated correctly without double-counting
4. Breakfast-history and daily-summary endpoints are consistent

**Use Department 3:**
- Admin: admin3
- Analyze existing sponsored meal data
- Verify the specific 5‚Ç¨ discrepancy is eliminated
