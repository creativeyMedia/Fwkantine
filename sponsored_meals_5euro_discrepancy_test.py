SPONSORED MEALS 5€ DISCREPANCY TEST

FOCUS: Test the daily summary calculation for sponsored meals to verify the persistent 5€ discrepancy issue.

**SPECIFIC TEST SCENARIO FROM REVIEW REQUEST:**
1. Create a fresh test scenario with 5 employees in a department
2. Have them order lunch (5×5€ = 25€)
3. Have one additional employee order breakfast with an egg (0.50€)
4. Sponsor the lunch for all 5 employees
5. Check the daily summary total_amount - it should show 25.50€ but verify if it shows 30.50€ (5€ extra)
6. Also check individual employee balances vs the daily summary calculation
7. Identify where the extra 5€ is coming from in the total_amount calculation

**CRITICAL ENDPOINT TO TEST:**
- /api/orders/breakfast-history/{department_id} endpoint which contains the total_amount calculation

**EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**
- 5 employees order lunch only (5×5€ = 25€)
- 1 additional employee orders breakfast with egg (0.50€)
- Total should be 25.50€
- After sponsoring lunch for 5 employees, total should remain 25.50€ (NOT 30.50€)

**Use Department 3:**
- Admin: admin3
- Focus on breakfast-history endpoint total_amount calculation
- Verify no 5€ extra is added to the total
